# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

# Apple Homepage Clone

This repository contains a clone of the Apple homepage built using React.js for the frontend and Node.js with MySQL for the backend. The project is divided into three main parts:

1. **Frontend** - The frontend uses React.js to create a dynamic and interactive user interface. It's been designed to replicate the original Apple homepage, providing a similar user experience.

2. **Backend** - The backend is developed using Node.js and MySQL. It serves as the backend for the iPhone page, receiving and storing information sent from the form.

3. **Form** - A simple form designed with HTML and CSS, which can be opened directly in the browser. It's used to gather information like images, names, and prices, which are then sent to the backend.

## Frontend

The frontend part of the project uses React.js to create a dynamic and interactive user interface. It mimics the original Apple homepage, offering a user experience that is as close to the original as possible.

## Backend

The backend is crafted using Node.js and MySQL. It's set up to receive and store data specifically for the iPhone page. The reason for focusing on the iPhone page is to illustrate that the same setup could be extrapolated for other product pages as well.

## Form

The form is a simple HTML and CSS construct that can be opened directly in a web browser. It's used to collect data such as images, names, and prices, which are then dispatched to the backend. This form functions as an admin interface for adding and updating the product details on the iPhone page.

## How to Run

To run this project locally, Node.js and MySQL need to be installed on your machine. Clone the repository, navigate to each of the frontend, backend, and form directories separately, and run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies. Then start each of them with `npm start`.

Please note that you'll need to set up your own MySQL database and update the connection details in the backend code.

## Demo and Portfolio

Check out the live demo of this project [here](https://appleclone-4367a.web.app/). You can also see my other projects on my [portfolio page](https://danieladisu.com/).

## Disclaimer

This project is for educational purposes only and is not affiliated with or endorsed by Apple Inc.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
